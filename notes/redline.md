# Methods

## Task definition
    Try to explain the abstract definition of the taks.

there is input data of a certain form.

that has to be transformed into a different data type.
Then a model needs to be trained on that to predict certain lables. These labels also need to be created. 

That these have to be created is not important. 

## Dataset

data set structure, user name / folder / email

how the previous sources cleane their dataset, 

My goal and how to clean 

Which folders are dropped.

how big the data set is after dropping the folders.

comparing to previous work.

explanation of why it differs.

size of cleaning further.



emails had ids, email, internal email, server id, to, cc, from fields and sometimes tread fields with to, cc, from.

also ownership clause and >'s

the analysis is done pre truncation.
this was removed

why a certain cleaning step was so important. and and other one too before removing doc ids.

(Should I ask why!!!!! Ask Yubao)
Why word and character analysis was done.

why is it important to explain why it is important to know if it is a normal distribution.
Expanantion why it is not a normal distribution. Showing again. and what the conclusion is

why Similarity is im[portant.
How similarity is shown. and that it is not a perfect bell curve. What this implies

how de training was conducted. how many emails were used first and why. If one of the goals was achieved a bigger one was used. Why other research has done the same

explain why our method is different. The ratio was maintaned in the making of the datasets.
## Query and ID Construction
how the training set was created.
how ids were created
queries were created
then how queryies were generate.
why two methods were used for query generation

### Text Rank

two goals text rank was used for.

difference between achieving the two goals

the formula

and the parts of the formula are explained.

### inference

## Model Training

Type of architechture

why this one is chosen

the steps of training the model

what is done in indexing
what tay et al does

why one does something other then the other person

what goes in and what goes out

what the previous step did and what the current one does now
