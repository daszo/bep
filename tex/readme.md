You are required to use either:
 - uva-bachelor-thesis-single-frontpage.tex
 - uva-bachelor-thesis-with-additional-frontpages.tex

as a front page (or front pages) for the Bsc Kunstmatige Intelligentie thesis.

The first option _uva-bachelor-thesis-single-frontpage.tex_ contains only a single official 'voorblad', with required information.

The second option _uva-bachelor-thesis-with-additional-frontpages.tex_ consists of three pages:
	- a cover page: with the title, your name, and an image
	- a credits page stating the origin of the image
	- the official 'voorblad' (also contained in the first option) 
The file _augmented-intelligence.jpeg_ is preferably changed to an image relevant for your thesis topic (see comments in the .tex-file).  


For both versions the fields commented with _CHANGE_ need to be adapted for your thesis.
For both versions the file _uva\_logo.png_ is required.
