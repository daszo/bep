\section{Introduction}


To what extend can GR be applied to detect fraudulent language markers in the Enron Corpus?
(intent detection or emotion detection)

1. RQ1: How does Generative Retrieval outperform BM25 and dense vector embeddings on general document retrieval within the Enron Corpus. \\
2. RQ2: How effectively does GR retrieve fraudulent documents in the Enron Corpus. \\

\section{Related Research}

Fraud detection is a growing field. Fraud detection on textual unstructured data is novel and unsolved \cite{blanco2020manifestation, noever2020enroncorpusemailbodies}. Also no trustworthy and peer reviewed research has been published about this. It could be possible to detect fraud from text because perpetrators might leave behind linguistic markers or show emotions that are common with fraud.

To be able to do research on this it is imperative that there is a large corpus which contains fraud. This is why the Enron corpus is such an addition to the field \cite{klimt2004introducing,klimt2004enron, enron_dataset}. Enron was energy company that specialized in oil and gas and filed for bankruptcy in 2001 \cite{BritannicaEnron, FBIEnronCase}. During the investigation this dataset was made public and a cleaned version is publicly available \cite{enron_dataset}. 

Could it be possible to retrieve fraudulent documents. The field of information retrieval is old and has had many different systems to achieve this goal. One that has been dominant for a while is BM25 \cite{INR-019}. This uses in part the inverted term frequency index to search for documents. This is limited because of the semantic gap. This is where certain tokens in the document that are important for meaning do not show up in the query even though they are similar. Newer but computationally heavier methods include dense vector embedding models \cite{bengio2003neural} solve this problem by translating query and documents to a vector representation and matching documents to a query by taking the cosine distance between their respective vectors. 

%TODO: move embedding models down to paragraph below

Recently there has been a paradigm shift in NLP processing with the introduction of Transformers \cite{NIPS2017_3f5ee243}. This is a version of a recurrent neural network that encodes not only tokens but also their position. This done called attention. Where before language models were build by linguists, mapping words to synonyms or related words now a neural network can be trained on really large corpus and learn this behaviour unsupervised. Because of the size these are commonly refered to as Large Language Models (LLMs).

This opens up the question. Could this be used for retrieving documents? This where the field of Generative Retrieval Models comes in (GR). The advantage that generative

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Task Definition}


\subsection{Dataset}
The amount of emails present after dropping automatically generated folders is \NoFolderLength. This does include the inbox folders and sent / sent\_items / outbox. This is a similar amount to the cleaned dataset found in \citeauthor{klimt2004enron} although they found a value of 200,399 documents after cleaning. The selection of emails they used might have been different because their objective was classifying the folder an email belonged to and for that they only wanted human create folders. 

After cleaning further the amount of emails left is \GeneralLength.

% TODO: only use Q1 and Q3. Get too many too long documents out. Beginning is most interesting so truncating would be fine (happens automatically). Case study biggest email. \\
% TODO: Do distribution of folder per 
% TODO: 10 thoudand and 100. Slice of all the users. 
% TODO: T-SNE

The Word Mean \wordMean{} as shown in \ref{fig:wrd_count_kde} and \ref{fig:wrd_box_plot} is almost twice as big as the word Median \wordMedian{} which indicates that the word size is not a normal distribution. This becomes clearer when comparing the Q3 \wordQthree{} to the Max value \wordMax{} increasing the mean.

- TODO:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item analyze subject body similarity (how do I decide what model to use?)
    \item distribute folder size per user (bar plot automatically generated size and not automatically generated (maybe top 10))  
      \begin{itemize}
        \item how do to manage the amount of different folders in displaying
        \item add count distinct folder names
        \item folder name topics
      \end{itemize}
    \item analyze distribution of folder names.
    \item Cluster / topic modeling with LDA to reveal major themes
    \item Plot a temporal distribution of the emails
    \item figure out how at what size emails will be truncated and truncate them. 
  \end{itemize}
\subsection{Model training}
TODO: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the models (GR, BM25, Dense vector-embeddings)
    \item max pooling
    \item metrics
    \item Beam first search
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Query Construction}
TODO: \\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item make a 10k and 100k dataset that equally uses from all users and folders. By random data as well and size.
    \item generate elaborative descriptions
    \item generate queries (13k-100k for 100k) (half t5 query generation)
    \item do I need to generate separate test queries for evaluation? (extract 1000 to 5000 for the test)
    \item decide on the use of the following techniques
      \begin{itemize}
        \item text rank\\ 
          Text rank is great for ED because it is quick and cheap and keeps the core of the meaning intact. In making the ED, add in the subject. The sentences use for the ED are 1/3 of the sentences + subject that are in the email with a max of 3. Experiment if you dont get any duplicates
        \item **Will not use doc2query/docTTTTTquery \\
        \item put these into bibtex for reference
      \end{itemize}
    \item use document clustering for generating queries?
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{sentiment Analysis}
TODO: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Sentiment analysis on emotions like fear, anger, trust, anticipation, fear, love, sadness and surprise and analyze their relation ship to the convicted people. \cite{noever2020enroncorpusemailbodies}
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Reproducing research linguistic markers}
TOO: 
Use the linguistic Markers datasets to analyze which emails and users contain the most \cite{blanco2020manifestation} % TODO: refer to the direct datasets


\subsection{Query Construction}
TODO:
Create queries depending on the Linguistic markers dataset \cite{blanco2020manifestation} % TODO: refer to the direct datasets

\subsection{Fraud Evaluation}
TODO:
- Compare what was found to results found in \titlecite{blanco2020manifestation} and \titlecite{noever2020enroncorpusemailbodies}
- see if the found documents which are of the users that have committed fraud. This can be checked to which people have been persecuted (find source for this here \cite{FBIEnronCase})
