\section{Introduction}

A perpetual problem in financial markets is corporate fraud. Recently, fears of this have returned, with Nvidia rebutting its comparison to, Enron. Although the validity of this comparison is debatable, it is imperative that there are methods that can aid with the detection of such fraud. 

% Orienting Information

In the domain of fraud detection, the goal is to predict if a certain scenario is fraudulent. This can be done in two main ways. The first way is to utilize financial data or behavioral data and do what is called anomaly detection \cite{AHMED2016278}. The fraud can be seen as a form of deception and deception always leaves non-linguistic marks and linguistic marks.

Intent prediction is used for optimizing retrieval systems [explain retrieval more?] and is currently handled as a classification problem.\cite{casanueva2020efficientintentdetectiondual} \cite{10.1145/3295750.3298924}. Using intent prediction to detect fraud has not yet been done. There have been attempts to use linguistic markers and sentiment analysis to detect fraud in the Enron corpus \cite{noever2020enroncorpusemailbodies} \cite{blanco2020manifestation} \cite{klimt2004introducing}, but remain inconclusive.

With the Emergence of Large Language Models new ways of retrieving information have been developed. So is the newest addition DSI \cite{NEURIPS2022_892840a6}, which is in essence a LLM that predicts the id of a document given a query. 

% Whats at stake
As generative retrieval is a novel field it is still unclear what the practical applications are. Further, currently there is no method that has been proven to be able to predict fraudulent behavior in text. 

% My Thesis
Using the Enron corpus, this research uses GR methods to retrieve and thus detect fraudulent emails. It does so by first exploring the efficacy of GR compared to other methods like BM25 and dense vector retrieval. After that it explores how using linguistic makers and sentiment analysis to construct queries, GR can retrieve emails of prosecuted employees in the enron corpus. The hypothesis is that GR is solving intent detection task internally because of its inherent understanding of text and can link sentiment and linguistic markers to fraudulent emails.

\section{Related Research}

(add pshycho linguistic references)
To Fraud detection is a growing field. In particular, fraud detection on textual unstructured data is novel and unsolved \cite{blanco2020manifestation, noever2020enroncorpusemailbodies}. Moreover, no trustworthy, peer reviewed research has been published about this. It could be possible to detect fraud from text because perpetrators might leave behind linguistic markers or show emotions that are common with fraud.

To be able to do research on this it is imperative that there is a large corpus which contains fraud. This is why the Enron corpus is such an addition to the field \cite{klimt2004introducing,klimt2004enron, enron_dataset}. Enron was energy company that specialized in oil and gas and filed for bankruptcy in 2001 \cite{BritannicaEnron, FBIEnronCase}. During the investigation this dataset was made public and a cleaned version is publicly available \cite{enron_dataset}. 

Could it be possible to retrieve fraudulent documents. The field of information retrieval is old and has had many different systems to achieve this goal. One that has been dominant for a while is BM25 \cite{INR-019}. This uses in part the inverted term frequency index to search for documents. This is limited because of the semantic gap. This is where certain tokens in the document that are important for meaning do not show up in the query even though they are similar. Newer but computationally heavier methods include dense vector embedding models \cite{bengio2003neural} solve this problem by translating query and documents to a vector representation and matching documents to a query by taking the cosine distance between their respective vectors. 

%TODO: move embedding models down to paragraph below

Recently there has been a paradigm shift in NLP processing with the introduction of Transformers \cite{NIPS2017_3f5ee243}. This is a version of a recurrent neural network that encodes not only tokens but also their position. This done called attention. Where before language models were build by linguists, mapping words to synonyms or related words now a neural network can be trained on really large corpus and learn this behaviour unsupervised. Because of the size these are commonly refered to as Large Language Models (LLMs).

This opens up the question. Could this be used for retrieving documents? This where the field of Generative Retrieval Models comes in (GR). The advantage that generative

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Task Definition}
\label{subsec:task-definition}

Let $\mathcal{D} = \{d_1, d_2, \dots d_N \}$ denote the corpus of N email documents, which consists of subject, sender, recipient and sender. Let $\mathcal{Q} = \{q_1, q_2, \dots q_M \}$ represent the set of M queries. Further, we define $\mathcal{Y} = \{y_1, y_2, \dots y_N \}$ as the set of unique document identifiers corresponding to each email document. \\
Let $f_\theta$ be the GR model parameterized by $\theta$. The task of the model is to map query $q \in \mathcal{Q}$ or $d \in \mathcal{D}$ to output relevant documents identifier $y \in \mathcal{Y}$.

To do this, a training set is construction $\mathcal{T}$, this is defined as the union of the document-id pair and query-id pair~\eqref{eq:training-set}.
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{T} = \{(d,y_d) | d \in \mathcal{D} \} \cup \{(q, y_q) | q \in \mathcal{Q}\}
  \label{eq:training-set}
\end{equation}
Where $y_d \in \mathcal{Y}$ is the unique identifier assigned to document d and $y_q \in \mathcal{Q}$ is the unique identifier assigned to document q.

The GR retrieval model, $f_\theta$ follows an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder encodes the query q or the email document d and generates the unique document identifier y.

\subsection{Dataset}
The datalanalys is done before truncating the emails.
The number of emails present after dropping automatically generated folders is \NoFolderLength. This include the inbox folders and sent / sent\_items / outbox. This is a similar number to the cleaned dataset found in \citeauthor{klimt2004enron}. They found a value of 200,399 documents after cleaning. Their different number of selected emails may have been due to theirobjective to classify the folders that each email belonged to, for which reason they sought only folders created by humans. 

After cleaning further the number of remaining emails left is \GeneralLength. 

To clean the bodies of the emails, it is imperative to remove the extra syntax that email providers like outlook enter automatically. Preliminary experiments showed that retaining schema tags introduced significant noise. For a detailed ablation study comparing raw versus cleaned inputs, see Appendix \ref{app:schema_impact}. Also, messages smaller then 20 words are removed as they are to small to create queries and docids of.

For the word count the Mean \wordMean{} as shown in \ref{fig:wrd_count_kde} and \ref{fig:wrd_box_plot} is substantially larger than the Median \wordMedian{} which indicates that this is not a normal distribution. This becomes clearer when comparing the Q3 \wordQthree{} to the Max value \wordMax{}. The substantial gap explains the size of the mean. The same is applicable to the character count.  (TODO: add the skewness of the )

To determine if the subjects of the emails have any similarity to their respective bodies a sentence transformer will be used to calculate the embedding and the cosine similarity will be computed. In the process of calculating the cosine similarity the dot product of the subject and body embeddings is taken and the distribution is plotted in figure \ref{fig:similarities}. Although the distribution is unimodal, it is not a perfect bell curve. This is also apparent when looking at the Skewness which is a negative skew of \similaritiesSkewness. It is clear that the subjects and the bodies are very similar. \\

The training of the model was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, a set containing 10,000 emails was curated to verify if the data was suitable for the current objective and that the experimental setup contained no errors. When it was confirmed that the experimental setup was successful, a 100,000-email dataset was curated for the final training. \textcite{NEURIPS2022_892840a6} uses different sizes in datasets to give better insight into the performance of a retrieval methods, because different systems perform better at different size datasets. Due to limited emails contained in this dataset the 320.000-email dataset mentioned in the original DSI paper was not created in this experiment. In all curated datasets the ratio of emails per user-folder was maintained.

    \item figure out how at what size emails will be truncated and truncate them. 
  \end{itemize}


\subsection{Generating labels}
To train the model without manual labels, we construct training data solely on the email content and email subject itself, including email identifiers and pseudo queries.


\subsubsection{Email ID construction}
Identifiers should capture the essence of the mail while remaining compact. Following \textcite{10.1145/3690624.3709435}, we use text rank to extract key words of interest from the emails bodies. These keywords will server as IDs. Text rank is a graph based ranking system that scores text units, like words or sentences, based on their co-occurence or similarity respectively and selects the best text units using Page Rank \cite{ilprints422}.

A problem that arose is that text rank generates ids that are not always unique. In line with  \textcite{10.1145/3580305.3599903}, this issue was ignored because duplicate ids are for emails that are similar in contents.

\subsection{Pseudo-query construction}
When constructing queries it is important that the original words are contained but also cover the essence of the email. Which is why we use an extractve method and an abstractive method is construction. Textrank was employed to extract the most important sentence as pseudo query. For the abstractive query construction method the t5-headline transformer model \cite{pleban2020t5headline} was used for summarizing the email bodies.

\subsection{Model training}
Question: do I comment on the improvements between the original DSI paper \cite{NEURIPS2022_892840a6} and your improvement \cite{10.1145/3580305.3599903} or can I just quote that?
As specified in \cref{subsec:task-definition} $f_\theta$ is a GR model with the encoder decoder architecture. For this the T5 model was chosen because that is the standard used in previous works \cite{NEURIPS2022_892840a6}\cite{10.1145/3580305.3599903}. The training of the model is a joint mode of two parts i.e., indexing and the retrieval in an end to end way.\\
\textbf{Indexing:} This step is for memorizing information about the email documents, \textcite{NEURIPS2022_892840a6} takes a document and maps it to an unique document identifier.

\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{Indexing}{(\theta)} = \displaystyle\sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{D}} log P(y | T5_{\theta}(d_i))
  \label{eq:indexing-los}
\end{equation}

While \textcite{NEURIPS2022_892840a6} use only numerical ids \textcite{10.1145/3580305.3599903} use Elaborative Descriptions as the identifier. 

\textbf{Retrieval:} Given a query $q \in \mathcal{Q}$, the DSI model outputs the relevant document identifier y. For this the T5 model, previously fine tuned for indexing, is trained on the query-id pair.



\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{Retrieval}{(\theta)} = \displaystyle\sum_{d_i \in \mathcal{D}} log P(y | T5_{\theta}(d_i))
  \label{eq:retrieval-loss}
\end{equation}

For training the model, \textcite{10.1145/3580305.3599903} used top 10 greedy beam first search to help the model find a valid document identifier. This has also been used in this research. This works because a trie has been build using the unique document identifiers and guides the model to the right answers. For every word it generates, it predicts for every possible word the probability that it is that word. From that list, only the words that are in the trie are selected and the 10 highest probability are kept. For every consecutive the current probability is summed with the new word. At some point the trie ends and then the 10 most probable are ranked acordingly and scored.

For training, the data set queries were split up in three groups. The first 80\% was reserved for training and then 10\% for both validating and testing. The email bodies were exclusively reserved for training, because they serve only for learning the model what each unique document identifier means.

    \item add more information about the combination trainging and the beam search method

\subsection{Code}
For training of the model the code of \textcite{zhuang2022dsiqg} was used as a basis. It did need to be adapted to work with the sqlite database used in this research. This code however was made for numerical tokens and not semantic tokens. To solve this problem the code to build the trie was used from \textcite{LI2023103475}.

\section{Discussion}

The first 10k model had its pique performance at 15k steps, which is quite small compared to 100k steps. This highlights the model's sensitivity to structural patterns. It learned to prioritize the frequent 'Subject' token over the actual email content, a phenomenon known as [shortcut learning/template bias].
